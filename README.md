Applied Research – 6 Week Intensive Plan

This repository contains my structured 6-week plan to prepare for Applied Scientist and Deep Learning–focused Data Science roles.
The goal is to consolidate fundamentals, implement practical deep learning components, study interpretability and robustness, and practice applied research workflows through hands-on exercises and paper readings.

The structure of the repository is modular and organized by week. Each week includes notebooks, source code and self-assessment exercises.

Repository Structure:

week01/
    notebooks/        # Jupyter notebooks for DL fundamentals, interpretability and robustness
    src/              # Python modules with reusable implementations
    exercises/        # Self-assessment questions and small tasks

notes/                # Conceptual notes, definitions and summaries
papers/               # Paper summaries and reading templates
README.md             # You are here


Purpose of the 6-Week Plan

The plan aims to:
• Refresh and deepen core deep learning concepts
• Build intuition for neural network mechanics
• Understand and implement interpretability techniques
• Explore robustness, adversarial examples and evaluation
• Read and summarise key papers in applied ML
• Strengthen research-level thinking and implementation skills

This repo will track all work completed across the six weeks.

Week 01 Focus

• Deep Learning Fundamentals
• Activation functions and gradient behaviour
• Backpropagation mechanics
• Saliency maps and basic interpretability
• Introduction to robustness and adversarial attacks
• First applied research workflow

More details live inside week01/notebooks.

How to Use This Repository:

1. Navigate to the week you want to explore

2. Open notebooks inside weekXX/notebooks/

3. Reuse helper functions implemented under src/

4. Complete exercises in exercises/ to consolidate learning

5. Keep conceptual notes in notes/ and paper summaries in papers/

This structure is designed to scale smoothly across all 6 weeks.
